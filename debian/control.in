Description: wal2json is an output plugin for logical decoding. It means that
 the plugin have access to tuples produced by INSERT and UPDATE. Also,
 UPDATE/DELETE old row versions can be accessed depending on the configured
 replica identity. Changes can be consumed using the streaming protocol
 (logical replication slots) or by a special SQL API.
